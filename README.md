clean_room
==============================

Data science project that  predicts when the room it's clean or messy
Project Organization

Results
------------
In this project the main object it's to understaing better the library Keras and usage kaggle dataset. So in this project I started compare both convolution network and usage some data science technices. To understand better I recommend to run the notebooks first and see how they are working

Usage
------------

To usage the model, first is need to choose the image on external data. In file MakeFile you need rename the IMAGE_FILE to call the image you want select.

``` sh
make predict_vgg16
make predict_cnn_simple
```

The result is generated where you called make
